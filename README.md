# zeroLAB
A WordPress theme that contains only the absolute necessary elements to be recognized as a WP theme: functions.php, style.css and index.php, all of which as empty as possible (with the exception of a bit of Google Fonts magic to render the text in Roboto, because system fonts, especially Arial, cause us eye cancer). It is the most basic starter theme I personally know of. You will have to literally build everything yourself from here. Hint: the WordPress Developer Handbook is your friend! developer.wordpress.org

Please have a look at the stylesheet code (style.css) before you start. For example: if you are the paranoid type, you might want to delete the @import rule for connecting to Google fonts and be happy with Arial or whatever your system gives you for sans serif. Or you are in the know, how to use @font-face o local webfonts and start your coding journey on a light note from there â€¦

Enjoy
